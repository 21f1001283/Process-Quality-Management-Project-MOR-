Final year Master's project focused on applying Process Quality Management principles using Six Sigma and other quality tools to reduce defects in the manufacturing of aluminium candle stands at C.L. Gupta Exports Ltd.

## Process Quality Management for Aluminium Candle Stand Manufacturing

This project, completed as part of my Master's in Operational Research at the University of Delhi, addresses quality improvement in the manufacturing process at C.L. Gupta Exports Ltd., a leading exporter of handicraft items. The study applies Six Sigma's DMAIC methodology alongside tools like SIPOC diagrams, control charts, Pareto analysis, cause-and-effect diagrams, and AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) to identify, analyze, and reduce defects such as cracks, pinholes, and polishing inconsistencies in aluminium candle stands.

The primary objective was to lower the rejection rate by tackling root causes through rigorous data-driven analysis and recommending corrective actions. The project demonstrates significant improvement in process quality by adopting a structured Total Quality Management (TQM) approach, leading to higher customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

Techniques covered include:

Six Sigma DMAIC Cycle

Statistical Process Control (SPC)

Root Cause Analysis

SIPOC Mapping

Pareto and Cause-Effect Charts

Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP)

This comprehensive real-world implementation offers valuable insights into modern quality management practices in manufacturing.
